These are the programs that I have written during my Winter Workshop
at IIT Kharagpur of Image Processing.

## How to compile a code:
Let's say you want to compile the program `chessboard.cpp`, then all
you have to do is to execute this command:<br>
`make chessboard`

This will create a binary with the name 'chessboard' which can be easily
run by `./chessboard`.
